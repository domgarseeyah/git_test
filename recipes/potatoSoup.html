    <p>On a cold day in the fall, nothing beats soup. And hey who's to say we can't add bacon?</p>
<h2>What you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4-6 medium sized potatoes, peeled, diced</li>
        <p>The type is really a preference to you. I like red but, you may like yukon golden. Who Cares!</p>
        <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
        <li>12-16 oz of bacon</li>
        <li>1/2 stick of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>Two medium/large sized pots</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Cooking:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Start by cooking bacon, and draining of all excees oil. Crumble or break Bacon, set aside a couple of pieces for serving with the soup</li>
    <li>Boil potatoes to a point just before being easily breakable, the rest of the cooking will happen later</li>
    <li>In a pot (this will be the main container of the soup) start to melt butter</li>
    <li>As butter melts, slowly add flour and stir to avoid burning the mixture. If it does start to burn, restart. This is the base to your soup and luckily the fix is quick and easy</li>
    <li>As mixture begins to thicken, add heavy cream and continue to stir</li>
    <li>Begin adding the potatoes and bacon. It may be easier to cut or crumble the bacon, but it does also break apart if it is cooked enough</li>
    <li>Add milk, ensure that all parts of the soup are melding together, lower heat and let cook for 20 min</li>
    <li>When serving take extra side bacon, cut into tiny pieces and sprinkle on soup as desired </li>
    </ol>
